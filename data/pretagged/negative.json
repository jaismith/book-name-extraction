I strongly, strongly recommend that you acquire paper copies of 13, as opposed to trying to get by with PDFs or especially Kindle editions if they exist for these titles. In part, I think this is often important during nonCOVID times for a variety of reasons that I could go into but wont now. But especially with our course online, its going to be much easier and pedagogically superior to have a copy of the text that does not require that whenever you want to look at a passage during discussion you need to click away from the Zoom screen. You also need 4 and 5, but its not clear to me that eversions will provide you with a suboptimal learning experience. Personally, I would want a paper copy of 4 as well if I were in the course. However, I have a PDF of 4 and I will make it available to you on Canvas when I send an email with the initial reading assignment. If you do order a copy of 4, you wont have to worry that youll have problems doing reading in 4 as you wait for your copy to arrive, since youll be able to look at the PDF. I dont have PDFs of any of the remaining books.", "Almost all of the reading will be available in PDF form. The exception is the following THREE works note originally, I only had two listed, which we will read large portions of. It is strongly recommended that you acquire PAPER copies of the following, not simply Kindle or other eversions. Toggling back and forth between a PDF on your computer and a synchronous zoom session is difficult and a major problem with discussion for those using a Kindle edition is that they cannot locate or communicate to others a passage in the text using a page number. Finally, even for those who are reasonably skilled in using electronic functions to annotate and underline, it tends not to work as well as oldfashioned underlining and marginalia.
